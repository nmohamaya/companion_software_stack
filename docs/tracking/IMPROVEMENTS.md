# Improvements Backlog

Running list of improvements noticed in passing while doing other work. Not urgent enough to derail the current task, but worth fixing when we look for lighter work or take a breather between deep sessions.

**How to use:**
- New findings go at the top of the current date's section.
- When a finding is addressed, move it to the bottom **Resolved** section with the PR/commit reference.
- Priority is a quick read, not a promise:
  - **P1** — blocks or will block something real (CI, build, deploy)
  - **P2** — obvious paper cut, worth fixing in the next quiet window
  - **P3** — minor, nice to have, fix if you're already touching the area

**Categories:** `build`, `ci`, `docs`, `dev-tooling`, `test-infra`, `workflow`, `architecture`, `scripts`.

### 2026-05-05 (PR #704 review — deferred follow-ups)

Items from the 9-agent review pass on PR #704 (Cosys ground-truth perception baseline) deemed correct-but-deferred or out-of-scope.  Addressed-in-PR items are listed in the PR's Review Fixes table.

#### Cosys segmentation backend

- **P2** (architectural) — Frame synchronisation between Scene RGB (P1 publishes, P2 consumes via `frame_data` parameter) and Segmentation (`CosysSegmentationBackend::infer()` re-fetches via `simGetImages`).  Different RPC calls = potentially different simulator ticks; on a moving drone this misaligns masks vs depth.  Proper fix: have P1 publish Scene + Segmentation in one `simGetImages` call, P2 consumes both from one wire type.  Workaround in this PR: timestamp output from the segmentation response so downstream knows when masks were captured.  See `common/hal/include/hal/cosys_segmentation_backend.h::infer()`.
- **P2** (perf) — Mask-buffer pooling.  Each `ObjAccum::mask` is `std::move`d into the `InferenceOutput`, so masks don't survive across frames.  At 1080p × 30 Hz × 10 objects this is ~600 MB/s heap churn.  Proper fix: separate `mask_pool_` of `vector<vector<uint8_t>>` swapped in/out of each `ObjAccum`.  Out of scope for this PR (touches the move-semantics of `InferenceDetection::mask`).
- **P3** — `infer_count_` is plain `uint64_t` with modulo-100 logging.  At >584 years of inference it wraps; theoretical, not blocking.

#### Cosys Echo / GT-radar backends

- **P2** (perf) — `DRONE_LOG_INFO` on the polling thread.  spdlog is mutex-protected, technically a CLAUDE.md "observability on flight-critical thread" violation.  Long-term: lock-free buffer drained by a dedicated IO thread.  Documented in DESIGN_RATIONALE.md as DR-026.

#### Diagnostic tools

- **P3** — `tools/diag/cosys_scene_inventory.py::propose_placement()` heuristic: `0.5 * max(scale.x, scale.y)` assumes unit-mesh actors.  Arbitrary UE5 Static Mesh actors need `simGetMeshPositionVertexBuffers`-based bounding box.  Not needed for the current Blocks-scene workflow.
- **P3** — `tools/diag/planner_grid_overlay.py` could emit absolute paths (clickable in terminals) instead of relative for the overlay-saved-to filename.

#### Test infrastructure

- **P3** — `FallbackBehaviourTest.SearchFailureKeepsLastGoodPath` (`tests/test_dstar_lite_planner.cpp:1450`) is pre-existing flaky/broken — `cached_path()` is empty after a failed plan when the test expects the prior path to persist.  Not introduced by PR #704; needs a dedicated fix-and-investigate session.

#### Documentation

- **P3** — Issue #621: API.md `IDepthEstimator` / `CpuSemanticProjector` / `IInferenceBackend` sections are still missing.  The new `cosys_segmentation_backend` factory tag was added inline to the IRadar table for now, but a proper IInferenceBackend section should be authored alongside the Issue #621 work.

### 2026-04-30 (#645 scenario-33 review-driven backlog — deferred items)

The 14-PR scenario-33 fix stack (PRs #646–#666) drove orchestrator reviews on the merged PRs.  P1 + most P2 fixes landed in batches (#667–#672).  The items below were deemed correct-but-deferred — risk-of-regression items (e.g. tuning thresholds that scenario 33 now relies on) and lower-impact hygiene items.

#### #661 — radar-confirmed promotion bypass

- **P2** (deferred — regression risk): `radar_bypass` triggers on `obj.radar_update_count > 0`.  Reviewer recommends raising to ≥3 (matching `radar_promotion_hits_`) to require the same multi-frame confirmation that the non-bypass path uses.  Risk: scenario 33 currently passes with the lenient gate; tightening it could re-introduce hover-fallbacks if radar tracks take 3 frames to mature.  Need a re-run of scenario 33 with the tighter gate to confirm no regression before landing.  See `process4_mission_planner/include/planner/occupancy_grid_3d.h:519`.
- **P2** (deferred — config tuning): scenario 33 has `max_static_cells: 0` (unlimited) **and** radar bypass enabled.  Without a cap, a radar fault that produced spurious tracks could flood the static layer.  Pre-bypass this was safe because `promotion_paused_=true` blocked the detector path entirely; post-bypass the radar path can write unbounded.  Set a defensive cap (e.g. 2000) once we have telemetry on real-world radar track counts.  See `config/scenarios/33_non_coco_obstacles.json:190`.
- **P2** (deferred — IPC contract change): `DetectedObject::validate()` doesn't bound `class_id` (could be any int) or `radar_update_count` (UINT32_MAX passes the `>0` gate).  Adding bounds requires touching the IPC wire contract and all serialiser/deserialiser tests.  Worth doing in a dedicated PR, not bundled with the scenario-33 fixes.  See `common/ipc/include/ipc/ipc_types.h:81-90`.

#### #658 — perception altitude/mask filters

- **P2** (deferred — config-validator wiring): four new perception config keys (`perception.path_a.altitude_filter.{min_z_m,max_z_m}`, `perception.path_a.mask_size_filter.{min_area_px,max_area_px}`) are not registered in `common/util/include/util/config_validator.h`.  The validator is the startup gate that catches typos before flight.  Add the four keys with `[0, 100]` m bounds for altitude and `[0, 4_000_000]` px for mask area.

### 2026-04-30 (scenario-33 forensics)

- **P2** — comms `fc_tx_thread` calls `latency_tracker_.record()` (mutex-protected observability) from inside `receive()`. PR #674 P2 review correctly flagged this as P2 per CLAUDE.md: "Mutex-protected observability primitives ... SHOULD NOT be called from flight-critical or real-time threads ... without documented justification." `fc_tx_thread` runs at 40 Hz and drives the SimpleFlight heartbeat — flight-critical. Tier rule: buffer into a lock-free primitive (`LatencyTracker` / `SPSCRing` / `TripleBuffer`) and let a dedicated IO thread drain into the shared observability. **Note:** the earlier claim that `record()` ran "inside `data_mutex_`" was factually wrong — the `lock_guard` in `zenoh_subscriber.h::receive()` goes out of scope at line 89, and `record()` is called at line 105 (after the lock release). The priority is still P2 per the project rule for any mutex-protected observability on a flight-critical thread, regardless of where in receive() the call sits.

### 2026-04-30 (scenario-33 keystone-fix follow-ups, from #652)

Surfaced while debugging the cube-collision failure mode through PRs #646/#647/#649/#650/#651.  PR #651 (SimpleFlight 60 ms heartbeat) was the keystone fix — the prior four PRs were correct but had no observable effect on the SITL plant because SimpleFlight was seizing control on the api_goal_timeout.  Items below are observability and configurability gaps that would have surfaced #651 weeks earlier (or made it a config change instead of a code change).

- **P2** — Make Cosys SimpleFlight `api_goal_timeout` configurable via `settings.json`. Currently hard-coded at 60 ms in `third_party/cosys-airsim/AirLib/include/vehicles/multirotor/firmwares/simple_flight/firmware/Params.hpp:136`. **Why:** PR #651 ships a comms-side heartbeat to beat the 60 ms window, but it's still fragile — any future scheduling jitter, increased mission_planner load, or third-party timing drift can push us back over.  A configurable timeout (default 500 ms for SITL, keep 60 ms for hardware-fidelity scenarios) would eliminate the entire failure class.  **How:** vendored-patch our submodule fork to read the timeout from `MultirotorPawnSimApi`'s settings JSON (which already passes other params).  Document the patch in `deploy/airsim_setup.sh` so it survives a clean checkout.  Follow up with an upstream Cosys-AirSim PR.
- **P2** — Surface `final_clamp_count()` (avoider) and `hover_fallback_count()` (planner) in `run_report.txt`. **Why:** Both counters were added during this debug push (PRs #646 and #650) specifically so operators can see post-flight whether the safety floor / hover-fallback is firing.  Currently the run-report parser doesn't read them — the only way to find their values is to grep the log manually.  Defeats half the diagnostic value.  **How:** add two lines to the run_report parser (`tests/scenarios/run_report_template.py` or wherever the parser lives) that scrape the last `[Avoider]`/`[PlanBase]` log line and surface the counters in the run-report observations section.
- **P2** — Add a scenario-runner check that `[UE5]` log does NOT contain "API call was not received". **Why:** This message is emitted by the simulator HUD AND visible only on screen during a manual run — easy to miss in a long mission.  Would have surfaced PR #651's root cause weeks earlier instead of through manual UI observation.  **How:** add a `must_not_contain` pattern to the scenario pass criteria scanning `cosys_ue5.log`.  Apply to all SITL scenarios, not just 33.
- **P3** — `fc_tx_thread` loop period and heartbeat threshold should be config-driven, not hard-coded.  PR #651 hard-coded `25 ms` loop and `40 ms` heartbeat for SITL.  **Why:** real-hardware FC links may want different cadences; future SITL backends may have different timeout windows; benchmark-harness scenarios should be able to suppress the heartbeat to test failure-mode handling.  **How:** add `comms.fc_tx.send_period_ms` to default.json with derived `kHeartbeatPeriod = std::max(period * 1.5, 30 ms)` so the two stay coupled.
- **P3** — Rename `direct_fallback_` flag and `using_direct_fallback()` method on `IGridPlanner` (and all derived classes / log lines / tests).  Kept in PR #650 to limit blast radius.  **Why:** the legacy name is a permanent landmine — anyone reading the code reasonably concludes "drone is flying a direct line through obstacles" when the actual behaviour is hover.  Cost 30 minutes of debugging in one of the early scenario-33 sessions.  **How:** mechanical rename to `is_no_path_hovering_` / `is_no_path_hovering()`.  Touches `IGridPlanner`, `GridPlannerBase`, `DStarLitePlanner`, `mission_state_tick.h`, ~10 unit-test sites.

### 2026-04-30 (#643 supersede — items not yet forward-ported)

PR #643 ("tracker tuning + diagnostics for scenario-33 ID-explosion") was branched on 2026-04-30 morning before the keystone fixes (#651/#660/#658/#659/#642 phase 4) landed.  Its scenario-config diff is now a regression vs current scenario 33 (would revert validated values for `position_clamp_m`, `min_confidence`, `instance_promotion_observations`, `max_static_cells`, `allow_radar_promotion`, `inflation_radius_m`, and the altitude/mask filters).  Closed as superseded.  Two remaining items captured here:

- **P2 (clock-jitter robustness, independent of perception accuracy)** — `VoxelInstanceTracker` ageing currently uses caller-supplied `now_ns` (P2 frame timestamp), not `steady_clock::now()`.  Under irregular frame delivery (load spikes, late callbacks), ageing fires at the wrong time.  Switching to `steady_clock::now()` decouples ageing from upstream timestamp jitter — but the naive switch conflicts with the #670 test pattern that drives ageing by passing future-`now_ns` values.  Right path: dependency-inject a clock function (default `steady_clock::now`) so production gets monotonic ageing while tests keep a fake clock.  Stands on its own jitter-robustness justification, separate from perception-accuracy.
- **P3 (observability for upstream-perception regressions)** — Tracker diagnostic counters: `last_aged_out_count_`, `last_match_failure_count_`, plus `last_aged_out=N, match_failures=M` in the P2 `[VoxelCluster]` log line.  These are the measurement that surfaces upstream-perception drift: high mint rate / frequent ageing = SAM confidence floor too lenient, projector emitting NaN voxels, or cluster-size minimum too low.  Surface when the next perception-accuracy regression needs investigation.

**Deliberately not carried forward:** #643's hypothesis to bump `tracker.max_match_distance_m` from 3.0 m to 8.0 m.  That was a band-aid for upstream noise (centroid drift exceeded 3 m/frame on the failing run).  Keystone fixes #658 (altitude filter) / #659 (mask size filter) / #660 (`min_confidence: 0.7`, `position_clamp_m: 30`) / #642 (instance gate) directly attack the centroid-instability source, so the gate should *not* need to be relaxed.  **Principle:** when the tracker mints excess IDs, fix upstream perception, never widen the association gate — a wider gate trades real-correctness (two pillars 5 m apart could merge into one tracked instance) for masking a perception bug.

### 2026-04-27 (#638 review-driven backlog)

The four-PR voxel-clustering stack (#639 / #640 / #641 / #642) had ~70 review findings across 8 reviewer agents.  P1 + high-value P2 fixes landed in the respective PRs; the items below were deemed correct-but-deferred (proactive backlog).

#### Phase 1 (#639) — voxel clusterer

- **P2** (declined for now): `uf_union` lacks union-by-rank; header docstring claims O(N·α(N)) but only O(N log N) holds without rank.  At our N (~5000 voxels/frame) the asymptotic gap is invisible, but the docstring should either be tightened or rank should be added.  Choose one when N grows or when a profiler shows the union pass dominating.  See DR-037.
- **P2**: extract `cluster_lidar_points()` analogue from `assign_instance_ids()` into a unit-testable free function so the inner Union-Find logic is exercised independently of the void-returning entry point.
- **P3**: replace `unordered_map<int,int> root_size` and `unordered_map<int,uint32_t> root_to_id` with flat `std::vector<int>` indexed by root.  Eliminates ~10k hash ops/frame at N=5000.
- **P3**: pre-`reserve()` `cell_to_voxel` to `N * 2` to reduce rehash/chaining cost in the 27-cell neighbour loop (135k lookups/frame at N=5000).
- **P3**: `assign_instance_ids` could return `Result<uint32_t>` (cluster count + error channel) instead of `void` — would also obviate the `count_clusters()` helper's second pass.
- **P3**: `count_clusters()` now O(N) distinct-id scan (correct, was max-id which broke under non-compact Phase 2 IDs).  Performance-equivalent at our N; flag if profiling shows it.
- **P3**: tests don't cover the Chebyshev=1 boundary in y/z axes — only along x.  A bug like `for (int dy = 0; dy <= 0; ...)` would not be caught.  Add a 3D adjacency test.
- **P3**: tests don't cover `min_pts=1` singleton-cluster boundary, single-voxel input, exact-eps boundary, or negative eps_m / min_pts.
- **P3**: `tracks/TESTS.md` not yet updated with `test_voxel_clusterer.cpp` (11 tests after #639 fixes) and the new baseline count.
- **P3**: `EnabledWritesOneJsonlLinePerBatch` style: tests use `instance_id = 0xDEADBEEFu` marker pattern only on the two disable tests; consider applying to other tests for consistency / future-proofing.
- **P3**: `pack_cell_key` 16-bit truncation now bounded by the kMaxCellIndex clamp at the call site (P1-A fix), but the function itself still silently truncates if called from elsewhere.  Either widen to 21 bits/axis (covers ±1M cells in 63 bits), or rename to `pack_cell_key_unchecked` to make the precondition explicit.

#### Phase 2 (#640) — voxel instance tracker

- **P2** (declined for now): hidden allocations in `update()` (4 local collections per call).  At N≤30 tracks the allocator pressure is ~40 alloc/s, well within budget.  Mirror the `VoxelClusterScratch` pattern when a profiler shows it matters.  See DR-038.
- **P3**: `Track` struct `observation_count` semantics — counts total re-associations, not consecutive frames.  If Phase 4 needs consecutive semantics for promotion gating, add a `consecutive_count` field.
- **P3**: `tracks_view` cache-hostile pointer-chasing pattern in inner match loop; a struct-of-vectors flat array would be faster at N=30 once profiled.
- **P3**: `next_stable_id_` wraparound check (today only triggers after 4B mints, but compounds with NaN-config DOS — handled defensively elsewhere; keep an explicit `++` wraparound assert as an additional layer).
- **P3**: split `update()` into `compute_candidates_` / `associate_to_tracks_` / `rewrite_voxel_ids_` private methods so association can be tested independently.
- **P3**: `default.json` missing `path_a.cluster` and `path_a.tracker` defaults; `cfg.get<>` falls back to ctor defaults silently.  Add the keys for visibility/auditability.
- **P3**: deterministic iteration via `std::map` for `candidates` and `frame_local_to_stable` would remove a class of test-flake risk (unordered_map order is implementation-defined).
- **P4**: `[[maybe_unused]]` on the `_` structured binding to silence potential `-Wshadow` warnings.

#### Phase 3 (#641) — instance-aware grid promotion

- **P2** (declined for now): `OccupancyGrid3D` ctor now takes 14 positional parameters.  Refactor to a `GridConfig` struct mirror.  Out-of-scope for #641; large blast radius.  See DR-039.
- **P3**: `instances_` map can grow unboundedly within a single mission leg.  `clear_instance_state()` is now wired to RTL/LAND (P1 fix), but a within-leg LRU/TTL eviction would bound worst-case memory in long-duration missions.
- **P3**: `tracked_instance_count()` / `promoted_instance_count()` accessors should be `noexcept` and `[[nodiscard]]` for consistency with the rest of the file.
- **P3**: structured binding `[id, rec]` doesn't use `id` — switch to `for (const auto& kv : instances_)` or `[[maybe_unused]]`.
- **P3**: `InstanceRecord` struct with one `uint32_t observation_count` field is borderline over-engineered today; keep for Phase 4+ extensibility (last_seen_frame_seq, total_voxels, etc.).
- **P3**: `set_promotion_paused()` / new instance-gate startup interaction in `mission_state_tick.h:79` overwrites startup pause every NAVIGATE tick.  Pre-existing pattern, not Phase 3-introduced; flag for separate refactor.
- **P3**: Add fault-injection scenario for the instance-promotion gate (mid-flight P2 restart should not bypass the freshly-cleared instance counters).

#### Phase 4 (#642) — scenario 33 enable

- **P2** (declined for now): No CI test that scenario JSON files load + reach consumers.  Parametrise `tests/test_config_validator.cpp` over `config/scenarios/*.json` to catch typos at unit-test time, not scenario-run time.  See DR-040.
- **P3**: PR body explicit binary-version dependency (Phase 1+2+3 must all be present).  Already addressed by stacked-PR merge order docs but a startup self-check log in P2/P4 for "instance_id is non-zero" would surface mismatches at runtime.
- **P3**: `_comment_instance_gate` operator note should include the ~1m promotion-latency-at-cruise figure for tuners.
- **P4**: `max_match_distance_m=3.0` is 15× the per-frame motion baseline — possibly too loose for nearby distinct pillars.  Tighten to 1.5 m if Phase 2 traces show ID flapping.

### 2026-04-22

#### (new) Revisit: extract PATH A (SAM + mask projection) into its own process

- **Priority:** P3
- **Category:** architecture
- **Noticed while:** Issue #608 PR 2 design discussion — weighing "new process P8" vs. "two more threads in P2" for the SAM + MaskDepthProjector pipeline.
- **Current decision:** Stay in P2 as threads (per-path factory from Epic #516 supports this cleanly). Data locality is the dominant factor — MaskDepthProjector needs frame, bboxes, SAM masks, depth, and camera pose, all of which already exist in P2.
- **Revisit trigger:** When the first real SAM backend lands (non-`SimulatedSAMBackend`). At that point, evaluate:
  - Does SAM's ONNX / GPU footprint cause OOMs, hangs, or CUDA-context fights that take P2's core detection/tracking down with it?
  - Is the GPU memory ceiling pushing us toward per-process cgroups + CUDA budgeting?
  - Would a restart policy specific to the ML-heavy SAM path (exponential backoff, disable-on-repeated-failure) be meaningfully different from the current shared P2 policy?
- **If yes to any:** extract PATH A to a new process (P8). The per-path factory means the extraction is primarily moving the two thread constructors and wiring new IPC hops; protocol-level breakage is limited to making `/drone_mission_cam` have a second subscriber and adding a new `/semantic_voxels` publisher location — both low-risk given existing patterns.
- **If no:** leave as threads, document the decision's residual risk in a DR entry.

#### 15. MaskClassAssigner copies full InferenceDetection (including mask pixel buffer) per mask per frame

- **Priority:** P2
- **Category:** architecture
- **Noticed while:** PR #604 review (E5.4 MaskDepthProjector). Performance agent flagged mask pixel buffer copy.
- **Current state:** `MaskAssignment` stores `hal::InferenceDetection mask_detection` by value. `assign()` copies each SAM mask's full struct — including the `std::vector<uint8_t> mask` pixel buffer — into `MaskAssignment`. At 30 fps with N SAM masks, this is N heap allocations per frame. Currently cheap (8×8=64 bytes per mask), but production SAM masks can be 28×28+ (784+ bytes).
- **Proposed fix:** Store `const hal::InferenceDetection*` or `size_t mask_idx` in `MaskAssignment` instead of a value copy. `assign()` takes `sam_masks` by const ref and the result is consumed immediately in `project()`, so pointer/index is safe. Eliminates all mask pixel copies on the assignment path.
- **When worth doing:** When integrating real SAM backend (non-simulated) — profile first to confirm it matters.

#### 16. Three heap allocations per frame through PATH A pipeline (scratch buffers)

- **Priority:** P3
- **Category:** architecture
- **Noticed while:** PR #604 review (E5.4 MaskDepthProjector). Performance agent flagged repeated allocations.
- **Current state:** Each call to `MaskClassAssigner::assign()` allocates `det_order` and `mask_matched` vectors; `MaskDepthProjector::project()` allocates `classified` vector. Total: 3 heap allocs per frame on this path. All are bounded small vectors (10-50 elements).
- **Proposed fix:** Add `mutable` scratch buffers to both classes, `resize()` and reuse each call. Reduces steady-state allocations to zero.
- **When worth doing:** When PATH A is hot-path in production — profile first to confirm the 3 allocs are measurable vs CpuSemanticProjector's per-pixel work.

#### 17. DRY: `make_depth_map()` test helper duplicated across 3 test files

- **Priority:** P3
- **Category:** test-infra
- **Noticed while:** PR #604 review (E5.4 MaskDepthProjector). Code quality agent flagged duplication.
- **Current state:** `make_depth_map()` is defined identically in `test_semantic_projector.cpp`, `test_mask_class_assigner.cpp`, and `test_mask_depth_projector.cpp`. Similar duplication for `make_sam_mask`/`make_det` helpers with divergent naming (make_mask vs make_sam_mask, make_det vs make_detector_output).
- **Proposed fix:** Extract into `tests/test_perception_helpers.h` (inline statics). Align naming across all test files.
- **When worth doing:** Next time any of these 3 test files are modified — or as a standalone cleanup PR.

### 2026-04-21

#### 12. HAL factory functions use `throw` instead of `Result<T,E>`

- **Priority:** P2
- **Category:** architecture
- **Noticed while:** PR #599 review (Epic #519 per-class config). P4 planner/avoider factories converted in this PR; HAL factories remain.
- **Current state:** All 7 factory functions in `common/hal/include/hal/hal_factory.h` (create_camera, create_fc_link, create_gcs_link, create_gimbal, create_imu_source, create_radar, create_depth_estimator) throw `std::runtime_error` on unknown backend strings. This is startup-only code but violates the project's `Result<T,E>` error-handling pattern.
- **Proposed fix:** Convert all HAL factories to return `Result<std::unique_ptr<Interface>>`. Update callers in all 7 process main.cpp files and tests.
- **When worth doing:** Standalone refactor PR — touches many files across the whole stack.

#### 13. No IPC-boundary validation of `class_id` before `avoid()`

- **Priority:** P3
- **Category:** architecture (defense-in-depth)
- **Noticed while:** PR #599 review — OOB array access via `class_id` as index into `std::array<T, 8>`.
- **Current state:** `mission_state_tick.h` passes `DetectedObjectList` from IPC directly to `avoider.avoid()` without validating `class_id` bounds. The avoider now has an in-loop guard (`if (ci >= kPerClassCount) continue`), but defense-in-depth says validate at the system boundary too.
- **Proposed fix:** Add a `validate()` method to `DetectedObjectList` or a free function that clamps/filters invalid class IDs before passing to downstream consumers. Log a warning when invalid IDs are received from IPC.
- **When worth doing:** When touching IPC types or adding new consumers of DetectedObjectList.

#### 14. CameraIntrinsics needs lens distortion model for real hardware (#601)
- **Priority:** P3
- **Category:** architecture
- **Noticed while:** implementing E1 `CpuSemanticProjector` (PR #602)
- **Symptom:** `CameraIntrinsics` only has pinhole parameters (fx, fy, cx, cy). Real drone cameras with 120–150° FoV lenses have significant barrel distortion — pixels near image edges can be off by 10–30px, causing 0.5–2m 3D position errors in the volumetric map.
- **Fix:** Extend `CameraIntrinsics` with Brown-Conrady distortion coefficients (k1, k2, p1, p2, k3). Apply undistortion in `CpuSemanticProjector::backproject()` via iterative Newton's method. If fisheye lens selected, add Kannala-Brandt KB4 model.
- **Trigger:** Implement when nav camera hardware is selected and calibration data exists. Zero impact in simulation (all coefficients default to 0).
- **Issue:** #601

### 2026-04-20

#### 10. `COSYS_SIMULATION_ARCHITECTURE.md` — parallel to the existing Gazebo doc

- **Priority:** P3
- **Category:** docs (architecture reference)
- **Noticed while:** filing issue #594 (GT emitter) — the existing `docs/architecture/SIMULATION_ARCHITECTURE.md` is Gazebo-only despite Cosys now being comparable in complexity (HAL backends, segmentation, `simSpawnObject` scene population, scenarios #29/#30, GT emitter).
- **Current state:** Cosys architecture is scattered across ADR-011 (the "why"), `docs/guides/COSYS_SETUP.md` (the "how-to-install"), and inline comments in `common/hal/src/cosys_*.cpp`. No single reference doc for the runtime architecture.
- **Proposed fix:** create `docs/architecture/COSYS_SIMULATION_ARCHITECTURE.md` mirroring the Gazebo doc's structure — HAL-mapping, RPC-surface inventory, scenario population via `simSpawnObject`, segmentation pipeline, GT-emitter integration, known limitations. Cross-link from the Gazebo doc and from COSYS_SETUP.md.
- **When worth doing:** after the #594 (GT emitter) + #573 (baseline capture) work stabilises the Cosys-side patterns — then we document what actually shipped rather than chasing a moving target.

#### 5. Stage-name constants (eliminate magic-string drift across P2/P4/tests)

- **Priority:** P3
- **Category:** architecture (benchmark harness consistency)
- **Source:** deferred from `review-code-quality` agent on PR #593
- **Current state:** Stage names like `"Detect"`, `"Track"`, `"Fuse"`, `"PlannerLoop"`, `"GeofenceCheck"`, `"FaultEval"` appear as string literals at each `ScopedLatency` site across `process2_perception/src/main.cpp`, `process4_mission_planner/src/main.cpp`, and `tests/test_latency_profiler_dump.cpp`. A rename at one site wouldn't break the build — the baseline harness would silently see a new stage name while the old name disappears.
- **Proposed fix:** `namespace drone::cfg_key::benchmark::stage_names { inline constexpr std::string_view DETECT = "Detect"; ... }` in `util/config_keys.h`. All three locations (P2, P4, test) use the constants.
- **When worth doing:** when a third consumer (dashboard / CI gating) needs to reference the same stage names, OR when a rename has to happen for real (e.g. renaming `"Detect"` to `"Detection"` to match a schema).

#### 6. `LatencyTrace::stage` as `char[N]` for trivially-copyable ring (perf)

- **Priority:** P3
- **Category:** test-infra (benchmark harness performance)
- **Source:** deferred from `review-performance` agent on PR #593 (also `review-performance` on PR #591, documented in DR-020)
- **Current state:** `LatencyTrace` holds a `std::string stage`. SSO keeps typical stage names (≤15 chars) allocation-free, but every `record()` call still does a `slot.stage.assign()` under the mutex — ~10 ns of unnecessary work per call on the hot path.
- **Proposed fix:** switch `LatencyTrace::stage` to `char stage[32]` (or `std::array<char, 32>`). Makes `LatencyTrace` trivially copyable, allows `memcpy`-based bulk snapshot in `traces()`, eliminates SSO dependency.
- **When worth doing:** when a hot-path consumer records at >1 kHz (current max is 30 Hz), or when a certification audit flags the SSO assumption as an unbounded-allocation risk.
- **Trade-off:** silent truncation of stage names longer than 31 chars — manageable with a static assert on each stage-name literal.

#### 7. TSan run for `AllRecordsLandUnderConcurrentWorkers` test

- **Priority:** P3
- **Category:** test-infra (coverage)
- **Source:** deferred from `review-test-quality` agent on PR #593
- **Current state:** The 6-thread × 500-record stress test guards against count mismatches but can't catch memory-ordering bugs without ThreadSanitizer. CI runs the test under default GCC; no TSan pipeline runs on each PR.
- **Proposed fix:** add a `bash deploy/run_ci_local.sh --job TSAN` step that runs `test_latency_profiler*` under TSan, and require it pass before landing changes to `common/util/include/util/latency_profiler.h`.
- **When worth doing:** when a real TSan finding slips through to main, or as part of a broader CI-coverage uplift.

#### 8. `[[likely]]` / `[[unlikely]]` on the profiler gate

- **Priority:** P3
- **Category:** code quality (micro-optimisation)
- **Source:** deferred from `review-performance` agent on PR #593
- **Current state:** `if (profiler) bench.emplace(...)` — branch predictor handles it perfectly after the first few frames, but an explicit `[[unlikely]]` on the null-branch would improve code layout in the default (disabled) path.
- **Proposed fix:** `if (profiler_ptr) [[unlikely]] { ... }` at each of the 6 call sites.
- **When worth doing:** when profiling shows the disabled-path overhead is measurable. Currently it's sub-nanosecond — not worth the readability cost.

#### 9. `= nullptr` default on `LatencyProfiler*` thread-function parameters

- **Priority:** P3
- **Category:** api-ergonomics
- **Source:** deferred from `review-api-contract` agent on PR #593
- **Current state:** P2's `inference_thread`, `tracker_thread`, `fusion_thread` all take `LatencyProfiler* profiler` as the final positional parameter with no default value. Every current caller passes it explicitly, but a future caller could forget and get a compile error instead of a safe-by-default null.
- **Proposed fix:** add `= nullptr` to the parameter in the function declaration.
- **When worth doing:** when a second caller of any of these thread functions appears (e.g. a test harness that wants to run the thread function with a mock detector).

#### 3. `compute_ap` — O(11 × log nP) via max-precision envelope

- **Priority:** P3
- **Category:** test-infra (benchmark harness performance)
- **Source:** deferred from `review-performance` agent on PR #590
- **Current state:** `compute_ap` in `tests/benchmark/perception_metrics.cpp` runs an O(11 × nP) scan over the precision-recall curve for each of the 11 VOC recall checkpoints. Measured ≈5 ms at N=1000, well under the 100 ms AC.
- **Proposed fix:** Standard VOC trick — sweep the precision curve right-to-left once to build a max-precision envelope (`max_precision[i] = max(precision_curve[i..end])`), then binary-search for each recall checkpoint. Reduces the interpolation step from O(11 × nP) to O(11 × log nP). Net: one extra O(nP) pass.
- **When worth doing:** benchmark harness scales to N ≥ 10 000 detections per scenario, or profiling shows `compute_ap` on a hot path.

#### 4. `std::stable_sort` in `compute_ap` / `match_frame` for cross-run determinism

- **Priority:** P3
- **Category:** test-infra (benchmark harness reproducibility)
- **Source:** deferred from `review-performance` agent on PR #590
- **Current state:** both `std::sort` call sites (confidence-desc sorting in `compute_ap` and `match_frame`) use unstable sort. Tie-broken predictions can land in implementation-defined order, producing non-deterministic TP/FP assignments (and therefore AP) across platforms when two predictions share the exact same confidence.
- **Proposed fix:** swap to `std::stable_sort`. ~10–20% slower at N=100 000 but still well within budget.
- **When worth doing:** CI gates AP across Linux × macOS runners, or an investigation chases a flaky AP delta to tie-breaking.

#### 1. Ninja/Unix-Makefiles generator mismatch on `airsim-build` blocks rebuild
- **Priority:** P2
- **Category:** build
- **Noticed while:** building PR #590 metrics framework
- **Symptom:** On a machine where `airsim_external-prefix/` was previously configured with one generator, subsequent `cmake`/`ninja` invocations fail with:
  > CMake Error: Error: generator : Ninja — Does not match the generator used previously: Unix Makefiles
- **Current workaround:** `rm -rf build/airsim-build/CMakeCache.txt build/airsim-build/CMakeFiles build/airsim_external-prefix/src/airsim_external-stamp/airsim_external-configure` then rebuild.
- **Fix options:**
  1. Pin the generator explicitly in `deploy/build.sh` (e.g. `cmake .. -G Ninja`) so every invocation matches.
  2. Pass `-G ${CMAKE_GENERATOR}` through to the `ExternalProject_Add` call for `airsim_external` in `cmake/FindAirSim.cmake` so the sub-project always mirrors the parent.
  3. Document the workaround near `FindAirSim.cmake` and in `docs/guides/DEV_MACHINE_SETUP.md`.
- **Recommendation:** option 2 — it's the root cause; options 1 and 3 are palliatives.

#### 2. `.gitignore` hides `perception_v2_detailed_design.md` from PR diffs
- **Priority:** P2
- **Category:** docs / workflow
- **Noticed while:** opening PR #590; the Universal AC from meta-epic #514 says "Update `docs/design/perception_v2_detailed_design.md`" on every sub-issue, but the file is gitignored (it's still a draft from 2026-04-18).
- **Symptom:** reviewers can't see whether the design doc was actually updated; the acceptance-criterion check becomes honor-system.
- **Fix options:**
  1. **(preferred)** Commit the doc — it's the canonical record for the rewrite now, not a draft. Drop the `.gitignore` entry; subsequent PRs update it in-tree and the updates show in diffs.
  2. Keep it local-only, require each PR author to paste a diff snippet into the PR body.
  3. Move the "update the design doc" line out of Universal AC into per-issue AC where applicable.
- **Recommendation:** option 1 when we're comfortable the doc is public-facing.

## Resolved

### 2026-04-30

- **P2** — `ZenohSubscriber<T>::receive()` recorded misleading IPC latency on quiet topics (sticky `has_data_` + stale `timestamp_ns_` made polled latency grow at 1 s/sec wall-clock).  Fix: only record a latency sample when the timestamp has changed since the previous `receive()`.  Resolved by PR #644 (cherry-picked forward).
